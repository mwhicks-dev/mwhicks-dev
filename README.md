### Hi there! I'm Mason.

I'm a college student studying mathematics, physics, and computer science at NC State University. I identify as he/they and asexual. (Feel free to ask me in private if you have any questions.)

Beyond academia, which is what the rest of this page is about, I am a fairly inactive gamer and ukulele player, as well as an avid animal lover (more info about my cat will be on my Twitter after he comes home 9/4). My favorite show is Steven Universe and my favorite color is orange.

#### My academia interests

##### Mathematics

Mathematics is, through and through, my primary academic concern. Like many, I consider math to be the language of the universe. Consequently, I'd like to learn as much as possible! I would like to graduate from NCSU with an undergraduate and, potentially, masters degree in mathematics. My studies follow both pure and applied mathematics, mainly as relates to physical and computer systems. Below are a list of my specific areas of interest.
* Calculus, in general
* Computational mathematics
* Combinatorics with a focus on graph theory

##### Computer Science

Although my studies and focuses are in the direction of software development and engineering, as is in demand right now and probably for a while, my academic interests are much broader! Currently, I do work on software-defined networking and cloud computing with [Renaissance Computing Institute](https://renci.org/mission-and-vision/), as well as
